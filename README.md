# cohost-embed

let's say we wanna share [this post](https://cohost.org/idadeerz/post/2410123-div-style-width-10) with our lovely friends. if we let cohost generate our embed, we get something a little like this.

![discord embed of a cohost post that reads "annoying dark mode users when it inevitably gets added to cohost by making this entire post permanently display in the light mode colors". the discord embed shows the text as white on a slate gray background.](.github/readme/embed-before.png)

**joke ruined :(**

but what if...

![a discord embed, but now the post is represented by a screenshot. the joke's much clearer: the post is in dark mode, but the text is black-on-white.](.github/readme/embed-after.png)

**joke saved :)**

## usage

1. take your post url (e.g. `https://cohost.org/idadeerz/post/2410123-div-style-width-10`)
2. position your cursor between `cohost.org` and the first `/`
3. type `.doggirl.gay` (thus turning the domain into `cohost.org.doggirl.gay`)

for example (spaces added for clarity):

```
https://cohost.org            /idadeerz/post/2410123-div-style-width-10
https://cohost.org.doggirl.gay/idadeerz/post/2410123-div-style-width-10
```
